        "remedy_advice": "Based on the headache and low mood (1/5),  possible issues could be:\n\n1. **Tension headache:**  These are often caused by stress and muscle tension.\n2. **Migraine (possibly):** While we can't diagnose, a headache combined with low mood could sometimes be a symptom.\n\n\nSelf-care advice:\n\n1. **Rest and Hydration:** Find a quiet place, lie down in a dark room, and drink plenty of water. Dehydration can worsen headaches.\n2. **Gentle Stretching/Relaxation:** Try some neck and shoulder stretches to relieve muscle tension.  Deep breathing exercises can also help calm down.  There are free guided meditations available online (YouTube is a good place to start).\n3. **Mood Boosters (since mood is low):** Listen to upbeat music, call a friend, or do something you enjoy, even if it's just for a short time.\n\n\nShould you see a doctor or seek mental health support?\n\nYes, if the headache is severe, persistent (lasts for days), or accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, vision changes, or numbness.  Also, a consistently low mood (lasting more than a couple of weeks) warrants seeking mental health support.  Many universities offer free or low-cost counseling services for students.  Don't hesitate to reach out \u2013 your well-being is important!\n"

        "remedy_advice": "Based on the user's report of feeling stressed and depressed, and a mood rating of 2/5,  possible common health issues could be:\n\n1. **Stress-induced anxiety:**  Stress from academic pressures, social life, or finances is very common amongst students.\n2. **Mild to moderate depression:**  Feeling down, stressed, and having a low mood for a prolonged period can indicate depression.\n\n**Self-care advice:**\n\n1. **Prioritize sleep and healthy eating:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night and eat nutritious meals regularly. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol.  This helps your body and mind cope better with stress.\n2. **Engage in relaxing activities:** Find something you enjoy that helps you unwind \u2013  listen to music, read a book, take a walk, exercise (even a short walk can help!), or talk to a friend.\n3. **Practice mindfulness or meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes a day of focusing on your breath can make a difference in managing stress and improving your mood.  There are many free guided meditations available online or through apps.\n\n\n**Should they consult a professional?**\n\nYes,  given the reported symptoms and low mood rating, the user should consider seeking support.  While self-care is important,  a low mood and persistent stress could benefit from professional help. They should consider talking to a doctor or a counselor at their university or college.  Many universities offer free or low-cost counseling services for students. Don't hesitate to reach out \u2013 it's a sign of strength, not weakness.\n"
